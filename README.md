# SwiftUI-Preview-Modifier

A custom modifier made to help make previews easier to set up.

A blog post about swiftUI previews can be found [here](https://www.designibl.com/post/swiftui-previews-thoughts-tips)

## How To Use

Copy the file PreviewCreator.swift into your switUI Project.

This modifier works like any custom modifier in SwiftUI so must be called using .modifier()

The simplest form is:

```swift
struct SomeComponent_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        SomeComponent()
        .modifier(PreviewCreator())
    }
}
```

This will result in both a light and dark mode preview being created.

To customise further you can add the following.

| Variable       | Default          | What it does when true |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| standardPreview | true | Creates a preview using the device selected in Xcode's top bar |
| darkMode | true | Creates a dark mode preview copy for each device chosen |
| accessibilityXXXLText | false | Creates preview copies that has XXXL text size turned on |
| iPhoneSE | false | Creates preview copies on iPhoneSE |
| iPhoneMax | false | Creates preview copies on iPhone 11 Pro Max |
| iPad | false | Creates preview copies on iPad Pro (9.7-inch) |

So a fully defined modifier would look like:

```swift
struct SomeComponent_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        SomeComponent()
        .modifier(PreviewCreator(
            darkMode: true,
            accessibilityXXXLText: false,
            iPhoneSE: false,
            iPhoneMax: false,
            iPad: false
        ))
    }
}
```

This has been built to my personal preference of having multiple Previews however could easily be modified to only have one or two.

I have kept the code as simple as possible so that you can change and add to it, to fit your projects requirements.
